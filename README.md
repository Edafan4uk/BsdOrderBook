# BsdOrderBook API

## Overview

BsdOrderBook is a .NET 8 application implementing a meta-exchange for optimizing Bitcoin (BTC) trades across multiple crypto exchanges. It finds the best price for buying or selling BTC while considering exchange-specific balance constraints.

The application consists of:
- A **console application** computes optimal trade execution.
- A **web API** (ASP.NET Core) that exposes this functionality via a REST endpoint.
- **Docker support** for easy deployment.

The system ensures that BTC trades are executed at the most favorable rates without transferring funds between exchanges.

## üìÇ Order Books Data

The application reads order books from the `order_books_data` file. This file contains multiple JSON entries, each representing an order book from a different exchange. The data is used to determine the best possible execution strategy while respecting exchange-specific balance constraints.

### **File Format**
Each row in the file consists of a timestamp followed by a JSON object containing bid and ask orders. Example:
```
1548759600.25189 { "AcqTime": "2019-01-29T11:00:00.2518854Z", "Bids": [ { "Order": { "Id": null, "Time": "0001-01-01T00:00:00", "Type": "Buy", "Kind": "Limit", "Amount": 0.01, "Price": 2960.64 } } ], "Asks": [ { "Order": { "Id": null, "Time": "0001-01-01T00:00:00", "Type": "Sell", "Kind": "Limit", "Amount": 0.405, "Price": 2964.29 } } ] }
```

### **Fields**
- **AcqTime**: The timestamp when the order book was retrieved.
- **Bids**: List of buy orders (price the buyer is willing to pay).
- **Asks**: List of sell orders (price the seller is willing to accept).
- **Amount**: BTC quantity available at the given price.
- **Price**: The bid/ask price in EUR.

The system processes this data to determine the best possible order execution strategy.
